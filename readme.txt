Pandemonium Pd Plugins
======================
Pandemonium is a plugin for running Pd patches in your DAW. Currently it has only been tested as an AudioUnit running in Logic 9.

Make sure you create a folder at /Library/Audio/Sounds/Pandemonium
and 2 subfolders in there: "Effects" and "Instruments"

Future features
---------------
- VST version
- Windows VST version
- directory listening, so you can edit your patches live whilst they're running in the DAW
